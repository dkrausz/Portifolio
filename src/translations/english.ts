  aboutMe: ` Hi, I’m Danilo Krausz. After 8 years working as a professional poker player, I decided to switch careers and dive into the world of programming. This transition has been both challenging and exciting —
   and many of the skills I developed in poker, like logical thinking, focus, and discipline, have helped me a lot in this new journey.
I graduated as a Full Stack Developer from Kenzie Academy Brazil, completing over 2000 hours of hands-on training. I studied technologies like HTML, CSS, React.js, TypeScript, Node.js,
 Express, PostgreSQL.On the front-end, I work with React and TypeScript to build responsive and clean interfaces. On the back-end, I use Node.js with Express, handle authentication with JWT, and manage data using Prisma ORM.
Right now, I’m looking for my first opportunity as a junior developer — whether front-end, back-end, or fullstack. Since I’m currently living abroad, I’m mainly looking for remote positions.

Passionate about technology, performance, and clean code. I work on building complete web applications — from the database to the front-end components. I've created projects using Express, JWT, Prisma, Zod, Tailwind, and other modern tools.
