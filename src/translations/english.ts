  aboutMe: ` My name is Danilo Krausz, and throughout my life, I’ve always been driven by curiosity, independence, and a desire to learn new things.
I began my professional journey as an entrepreneur in São Paulo, where I ran an electronics repair shop — fixing TVs, sound systems, DVD players, video game consoles, and other equipment. 
Later on, I managed a small neighborhood market, which gave me valuable experience in customer service, organization, and business management.
After that, I worked as a customs broker, handling cargo clearance for major companies like Bosch, Electrolux, and Faurecia. It was an intense and demanding role that required attention to detail, 
deadline management, and technical knowledge in international trade.
More recently, I spent around eight years working as a professional poker player, 
where I developed important skills such as logical reasoning, data analysis, focus, 
and discipline — all of which have proven very useful in my transition into the tech world.
I graduated as a Full Stack Developer from Kenzie Academy Brasil, completing over 2000 hours of hands-on training.
 I studied technologies like HTML, CSS, React.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
Lately, I’ve been focusing my studies and personal projects on React and TypeScript on the front end, 
and Node.js with Express and Prisma ORM on the back end, including JWT-based authentication.
I’m currently looking for my first opportunity as a junior developer — whether in front-end, back-end, or full stack. 
Since I live abroad, I’m especially interested in remote positions.
